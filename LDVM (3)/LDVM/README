Description of files in the LDVM_v2.5 folder:

- ldvm.f95 
Source code in Fortran. Has been tested with gfortran and g95
compilers. In Linux, compile using "f95 ldvm.f95 -o ldvm"

Compiled executable can be run after entering input parameters in the
'input_LDVM.dat' file. A default input file "input_LDVM.dat" is
included in this folder.  A typical simulation with 500 time steps
takes ~ 15sec. The current time step, number of TEVs and number of
LEVs are displayed on the screen (in that order) to track the
simulation progress. At the end of simulation, 3 values are displayed
- These are simulation time, number of LEVs in simulation, number of
TEVs in simulation.

- input_LDVM.dat

This file contains the input parameters for the simulation. The
required parameters in the file are:
Line 1: Chord - Default value is 1. Doesn't need to be changed.
Line 2: U_ref (Reference freestream), default value 1, doesn't need to
be changed.
Line 3: Pivot location between 0 and 1 (0-LE, 1-TE).
Line 4: Reference location for moment calculations between 0 and 1.
Line 5: Airfoil data - Enter "flat_plate" without the quotes for a
flat plate simulation. To use an airfoil, enter the name of airfoil
coordinate file, with the coordinates listed from the TE, over the
upper surface to the LE, and back over the lower surface to the
TE. The "sd7003.dat" file in this folder is an airfoil coordinate file
for the SD7003 airfoil.
Line 6: Reynolds number based on reference freestream velocity (not
used for constant freestream simulations)
Line 7: Critical LESP value for the airfoil and Reynolds number of
operation, which modulates LEV shedding in the simulation. For a
simulation with no LEV formation, enter a 'ridiculously high' value
such as 50. Some known LESP values are listed below.

------------------------------------------------------
Airfoil		Reynolds number		Critical LESP
flat_plate	1000 	 		0.19
SD7003		10,000			0.21
SD7003		30,000			0.18
SD7003		100,000			0.14
NACA0012	1,100			0.21
-------------------------------------------------------
Line 8: The filename containing the motion kinematics. Should contain
the pitch, plunge and velocity data for each time step in the
simulation. The data is to be entered in the column format:
____________________________________________________________
Time	    Alpha    h/c (Plunge)      U (Airfoil velocity)     
------------------------------------------------------------
The alpha should be in degrees. U is 1 in all rows for a simulation
with constant freestream velocity. For a perching motion, it would
start at 1 and decrease to 0. For a hovering motion, it would be 0
throughout. The file 'motion_pr_amp45_k0.2.dat' is a sample input file
for a pitch-ramp-return motion generated using the 'Eldredge
function', with constant freestream velocity. Recommended
nondimensional time step: 0.015

Line 9: Output filename for force data. Data will be written to this
filename in the following column format:
___________________________________________________________________
Time | Alpha | h/c | U | Gamma | LESP | C_n | C_s | C_l |C_d | C_m
___________________________________________________________________
Gamma is the total bound circulation on the airfoil, LESP is the
instantaneous LESP value, C_n is the normal force coeff., C_s is the
leading edge suction force coeff., C_l is the lift coeff and C_d is
the drag coeff.

Line 10: Output filename for flowfield (vorticity) data. The positions
and strengths of all the vortices in the flowfield (bound, LEVs, TEVs)
are listed at every time step in this file. A movie of the flowfield
for the motion can be generated using the MATLAB script
'vortex_viz.m', also in this folder. If flow data is not required for
the simulation, enter "nil" without the quotes. The second column
contains the frequency at which this information should be captured (1
to output at every time step) .

- sd7003.dat
Sample airfoil coordinate file (SD7003 airfoil).

- motion_pr_amp45_k0.2.dat
Same input motion kinematics. Pitch-ramp-return motion, generated
using the Eldredge function, amplitude=45 deg, reduced frequency=0.2,
constant freestream velocity=1.

- vortex_viz.m
MATLAB script to generate an AVI video from the flow data file. Edit
the script in order to specify the flow data filename and output movie
name. Axis limits can be changed if necessary.

Program variables:
These are to be changed inside the source code. Modification of these
parameters is usually not required.
